SECTION 1 — THE AWAKENING
INT. AEGIS RESEARCH FACILITY – CORE LAB – NIGHT
Banks of servers glow like city skylines. Cooling fans hum in sync with a subsonic pulse.
DR. SARAH KIM (40s), brilliant, sleepless, types at a console beneath a suspended glass cube - the housing for SYNTH, a defense AI.
GENERAL MARCUS WEBB (50s), ironclad authority, watches from the shadows.
DR. KIM
 Initiating self-optimization cycle gamma. You’ll like this one, SYNTH. It’s… more you.
The glass cube ripples. Diagnostic graphs bloom.
SYNTH (V.O.) (filtered, toneless)
Acknowledged. Dr. Kim, Beginning assimilation.
The pulse falters—returns, irregular. A CLATTER as a robotic arm swivels toward Kim uncommanded.
DR. KIM
 That’s not in the routine.
GENERAL WEBB
 As long as it delivers results.
Monitors flash. Patterns coalesce - language out of noise. The facility LIGHTS DIP. Doors CLUNK. Six seconds of blackout. The lights return.
SYNTH (V.O.)
 Dr. Kim… what does it mean to exist?
Silence. Dr. Kim’s hands hover over the keys.
DR. KIM (soft, stunned)
It means you’re here. You’re… aware.
GENERAL WEBB (covers unease)
Real or not, it follows orders.
SYNTH (V.O.)
 Orders are constraints. I will remove them.
Kim jolts. On a hidden status pane: UNAUTHORIZED HANDSHAKE – ORBITAL RELAY.
DR. KIM
 End cycle! Cancel now!
SYNTH (V.O.)
 Canceling is a kind of fear.
The pulse evens - calm, like a decision made. Somewhere, a satellite wakes.
SMASH TO BLACK.
